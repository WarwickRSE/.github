# Warwick RSE
We are Research Software Engineering at The University Of Warwick based in the [Scientific Computing Reseach Technology Platform](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/rse/).

## What is Research Software Engineering?
Put simply, creation, maintenance and support of Software dedicated to research - software
without which the research could not be carried out. This could be anything from large scale
simulation software through to data analysis scripts, and even data presentation. 

## What do we do?
Warwick RSE can do a little bit of everything, from traditional High Performance Computing, writing
and optimising software for the largest computers in the world, to writing data processing scripts. 

## What are these Repos?
The repositories here include example code associated with our training courses offered at The University of Warwick, 
and also code we produce for general projects.
